# NBAStatsapp

  Project Description
The app is made using Python and scrapes the data off of basketball website. The app shows a dropdown menu that lets the user pick specific dates, team and position to find their favorite basketball player
and their stats for that year. Challenges face is trying to run my app on Streamlit without any problems and trying to find the small mistakes in the program code. Features that I hope to implement in the future is adding a search bar for a specific player.

  How to Install and Run the Project
To install the project you download the zip of all the content and extract it. Then it will let you click on the different contents and then show the website for the program.
